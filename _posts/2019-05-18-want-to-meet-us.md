The MPF community grew a lot over the last year.
Want to meet fellow users or contributors?

We keep a list of [events](/events.html) where you can meet us.
Please also let us know if you plan to bring your custom machine running MPF
to an event and we will list the event and your machine.
If you machine is not yet listed in our [projects list](/projects.html)
also let us know.
You can get in touch in our [MPF-Users forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users).

Don't be shy!
We know that there are a lot of great projects our there.
Any project can be listed no matter how far it is.
Also let us know if you attend a show and want to meet up without bringing a machine.
